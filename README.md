Odin Recipe Webpage 

Introduction

The current project is a recipes web page that will display all I have learnt about HTML so far. I will do this by creating a web page that will show a range of 5 to 10 home cooked dinner recipes from the index page. I will also use a range of bold and Italic text as well as a few images.
