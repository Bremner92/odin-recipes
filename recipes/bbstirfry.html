            Steps
        </h3>
        <h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil. Cut the 
                    broccoli into small florets and roughly chop the stalk. 
                    Thinly slice the carrot (unpeeled) into halfmoons. 
                    Thinly slice the capsicum. Finely grate the ginger. 
                    Finely chop the garlic (or use a garlic press). 
                    Roughly chop the coriander. Thinly slice the long red 
                    chilli (if using).</li>

                <li>Add the udon noodles to the boiling water and cook 
                    until tender, 3 minutes. Drain the noodles.</li>    

                <li>
                    While the noodles are boiling, in a medium bowl 
                    combine the ginger, garlic, sesame oil blend, honey, 
                    soy sauce, oyster sauce and 2 tbs water.</li>

                <li>Heat a large frying pan over a high heat with a 
                    drizzle of olive oil. Add the broccoli, carrot and 
                    capsicum, and a splash of water and cook until tender, 
                    5-6 minutes. Transfer to a bowl. Return the frying pan 
                    to a high heat with a drizzle of olive oil. When the 
                    oil is hot, add 1/3 of the beef strips and cook, 
                    tossing, until browned, 1-2 minutes. Transfer to a 
                    plate and repeat with the remaining beef strips.</li>

                <li>
                    Return the frying pan to a medium-high heat and add 
                    the noodles, veggies, beef and any resting juices to 
                    the pan. Add the oyster sauce mixture and toss to coat. 
                    Simmer until thickened slightly, 2 minutes.</li>

                <li>Divide the beef and broccoli noodles between plates 
                    and top with the roasted peanuts, coriander and chilli 
                    (if using).</li>
