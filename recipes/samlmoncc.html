        <h3><p>Not just a pretty name, pearl couscous is downright 
            delicious to eat. The small, slightly chewy balls have 
            a toasty flavour that works beautifully with roasted 
            sweet potato and beetroot. Topped with succulent salmon, 
            this is a gem of a dish!</p></h3>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <div class="section">
            <ul><li>1 sweet potato</li>
                <li>1 beetroot</li>
                <li>1 brown onion</li>
                <li>1 sachet of smoked paprika</li>
                <li>1 pack of pearl coucous</li>
                <li>1 cube of vegetable stock</li>
                <li>1/2 lemon</li>
                <li>1 pack salmon</li>
                <li>1 packet Greek Style yogurt</li>
                <li>1 bunch mint</li></ul>
    </div>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <div class="section">
            <ol><li>Preheat the oven to 220°C/200°C fan-forced. Cut the 
                    sweet potato (unpeeled) and beetroot into 1cm chunks. 
                    Cut the brown onion into 2cm wedges. Place the sweet 
                    potato, beetroot and onion on an oven tray lined with 
                    baking paper. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with 
                    the smoked paprika. Season with salt and pepper. Toss 
                    to coat, then roast until tender, 25-30 minutes.

                    TIP: Cut the veggies to size so they cook in time. 
                    TIP: Beetroot stays firm when cooked. It’s done when 
                    you can pierce it with a fork.</li>

                <li>While the veggies are roasting, heat a drizzle of 
                    olive oil in a large frying pan over a medium-high 
                    heat. Add the pearl couscous and toast, stirring 
                    occasionally, until golden, 1-2 minutes. Add the water 
                    and crumble in the vegetable stock (1 cube for 2 people 
                    / 2 cubes for 4 people). Reduce the heat to medium and 
                    simmer, stirring occasionally, until the couscous is 
                    tender and the water is absorbed, 10-12 minutes. 
                    Transfer to a large bowl.</li>    

                <li>While the pearl couscous is cooking, zest the lemon to 
                    get a pinch, then slice into wedges. In a small bowl, 
                    combine the Greek-style yoghurt and a generous squeeze 
                    of lemon juice. Season to taste.</li>

                <li>Return the frying pan to a medium-high heat with a 
                    drizzle of olive oil. Season the salmon with salt and 
                    pepper on both sides. When the oil is hot, cook the 
                    salmon, skin-side down first, until just cooked through, 
                    3-4 minutes each side (depending on thickness).

                    TIP: Salmon can be served slightly blushing in the 
                    centre.</li>

                <li>Pick and roughly chop the mint leaves. Add the roasted
                     veggies, lemon zest, a drizzle of olive oil and the 
                     mint (reserve a little for garnish!) to the pearl 
                     couscous. Season to taste.</li>

                <li>Divide the mint pearl couscous and seared salmon 
                    between plates. Drizzle with the lemon yoghurt and 
                    sprinkle with the reserved mint. Serve with any 
                    remaining lemon wedges.</li></ol>
