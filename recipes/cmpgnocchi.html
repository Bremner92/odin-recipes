            <li>250g sliced mushroom</li>
            <li>1 pack of gnocchi</li>
            <li>1 packet of light cooking cream</li>

    </div>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <div class="section">
        <ol><li>Finely chop the brown onion. Finely chop the 
                    garlic.</li>

                <li>Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large frying pan over 
                    a medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring, 
                    until softened, 5 minutes. Add the sliced mushrooms 
                    and butter and cook until browned and softened, 8-10 
                    minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, 1-2 
                    minutes.</li>    

                <li>Heat a generous drizzle of olive oil in a separate 
                    large frying pan over a medium-high heat. When the 
                    oil is hot, add 1/2 the gnocchi in a single layer and 
                    fry, tossing occasionally, until golden, 6-8 minutes. 
                    Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a plate. 
                    Repeat with the remaining gnocchi. TIP: Add more olive 
                    oil if the gnocchi is sticking to the pan. TIP: No 
                    need to boil the gnocchi before frying!</li>

                <li>Return the pan containing the mushrooms to a low heat 
                    and stir in the light cooking cream, salt, grated 
                    Parmesan cheese (reserve some for garnish!) and baby 
                    spinach leaves until wilted, 1-2 minutes. When the 
                    mixture is heated through, add the gnocchi to the pan 
                    and stir to combine.</li>

                <li>Thinly slice the pear (see ingredients). In a medium 
                    bowl, combine the balsamic vinegar and a good drizzle 
                    of olive oil. Add the rocket leaves and pear to the 
                    dressing and toss to coat.</li>

                <li>Divide the creamy mushroom and Parmesan gnocchi 
                    between bowls. Sprinkle over any reserved Parmesan. 
                    Serve with the rocket and pear 
                    salad.</li></ol>
